# pfam-domain-generator
Legacy Pfam-style domain graphics generator. The Pfam website will be available at legacy.pfam.xfam.org until January 2023, when it will be decommissioned. It is still online, but not known for how long.

## Generate domain images
This tool allows you to generate custom Pfam-style domain graphics. The input to the form is a JSON string that provides a description of the graphic. You can see the specification of the domain graphics on the help pages. You can also generate the domain graphic for a Uniprot sequence.

In some browsers you can right-click on the domain graphics image and save it to your local disk. This is known to work with firefox. If you are using a different browser, you may need to capture the image as a screenshot in order to use it elsewhere.
